# MATLAB Programs:
1. Ploterps.m is the program used to plot the ERP waveforms and topographical maps included in our recent paper on Threat-Biased attention and facial emotion processing. 
2. TopoDifferenceAndTscoresEmo.m is the program used to make the topo map showing the difference between two conditions (e.g., threat vs. non-threat faces) and plot the electrodes showing significant difference (t-tests) after an FDR adjustment of 0.05.
3. ERPMeasurementsEmo.m is the program used to conduct ERP measurement, e.g., local peak amplitude and latency, mean ampltiude, and area under the curve, etc.

# The ERP data in ERPLAB format has been published on Mendeley.com:  

# Eyetracking data:
EyetrackingData_and_ERPmeasures.csv contains the eye-tracking data, as well as the eye-tracking and ERP bias scores used in our study.
